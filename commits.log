777725d Added in NXMs for source and destination tunnel IPs, included in new Loxigen 0.9.0. Used Loxigen's OFFlowModFlags serializers for different OFVersions to fix compile error in StatsReplySerializer introduced upon Loxigen upgrade. Add new OF1.4 counters to DebugCounters to allow unit tests to compile (this is the first step in OF1.4 support =) ).
70bbe6d Updated all unit tests with the uncommenting of debugcounter stuff in the previous commit. For the most part, initialized the MockDebugCounterService and provided it to the MemoryStorageSource to allow counters in the AbstractStorageSourceService.
d1dc043 Fixed some debugcounter @Ryan's. Removed some @Ryans that have already been addressed.
95d16cf Fixed some issues with the Firewall and string compares. There are probably some more things that need to be fixed there.
21f6a55 Commented my edits to the NotificationManagerFactory's init() function.
f7d14cd Removed all deprecated flowcache references and marked all flowcache classes as deprecated. Also TODOed the OFMessageDamper Forwarding module unit test. It will always fail until tthe OFMessageDamper is fixed to ignore the XIDs in OFMessages.
a422012 OF1.3 handshake unit tests updated. All unit tests can be run together and have zero errors but one failure. The failure is in Forwarding and is expected for the time being until OFMessageDamper/Loxigen is fixed to ignore XIDs in OFMessages. In the previous commit, the unit tests for the flowcache package were completely removed due to the effort required to fix them. I don't know if completely removing the flowcache package though is the best idea. Even if it's not tested and not proven scalable, people might benefit from being able to look at the code. Thus, I've left the package in, at least for the time being.
26ce679 This is a scattered commit, but it includes more unit test fixes, including Forwarding and the NotificationManager's interdependency issue the unit tests were having when being run together as a group. It also includes some typo repairs. The last major change is a bug fix in the LinkDiscoveryManager that fixes the long-time issue of LINK_ADDED and PORT_STATUS messages being inconsistent when a link is brought up. The issue was a race condition between the PORT_STATUS update timer to process the queues and the propagation of LLDP packets from one switch to another that cause the LINK_ADDED updates.
3d6a093 Removed old string OFFlowMod-composition code from LoadBalancer.
b2914d3 Moved a couple annoying debug messaged to trace wrt switch connections. Changed logback.xml to debug and higher-level. Removed unused imports and variables in some places to clean up warnings that have arisen over time/mods. Fixed the LoadBalancer so it works with OF1.0 and OF1.3; it no longer composes OFFlowMods using strings! =)
dbccc49 Mid-way through Forwarding unit tests. Added a sample equals to compare OFPacketIns when the XID does not matter (in net.floodlightcontroller.util.OFMessageComparisonUtils.java).
d863f45 Forgot to fix Hub after playing with it initially. Now defaults to FLOOD OFPacketOuts at the controller, which means no flows are inserted. The option still exists to insert flows instead.
4a46891 Firewall working and unit tests working. Found an fixed a couple bugs in the Firewall during the process.
e430972 Removed unused imports from DeviceSyncRepresentation.
7dadba5 Some Firewall unit test fixes. Went through all code and corrected pi.getInPort() to (pi.getVersion().compareTo(OFVersion.OF_12) < 0 ? pi.getInPort() : pi.getMatch().get(MatchField.IN_PORT)). OF1.2 and greater specifies the ingress port as an OXM in the Match.
b007ece Removed unused import in SFEP.
1631b49 Fixed StaticFlowEntryPusher unit tests and a bug in the SFEP.
6df2eb3 Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/rizard/floodlight Pull in Hung-Wei's WEBUI changes. Then, push Ryan's unit test changes to remote again.
be3be8d Fixed DeviceManagerImplTest unit tests. TODO: With OpenFlowJ-Loxi, an untagged VLAN can be denoted with VlanVid.ZERO. Presently, it's VlanVid.of(-1), which was the case before integration of the new library. It makes more sense to have it as ZERO I think.
05b4b94 Merge pull request #5 from hwchiu/openflow-1.3
5fad7e1 Make the WEBUI shows the flow info
478b00c  complete the serialization of PortDescStats and PortStats, also modfiy the webui to fit the new-format of restapi
999714b serialize the portStatsReply and modify the webui
ec6fc33 		Try to fix the WEBUI
2ccdc1b Fixed some DeviceManager unit tests and (not quite a bug but) an issue converting an Entity to a SyncEntity, which requires primitives for serialization. I tried to supply the MacAddress, IPv4Address, etc JSON serializer classes via the @JsonSerialize annotation, but the serializer still didn't do it...
4f2f969 VirtualNetworkFilter unit tests complete. Found bug in Entity in devicemanger package where null doesn't mean no switch or port anymore; DatapathId.NONE and OFPort.ZERO do instead. An object will always be there (not null), but it's contents will specify whether the Entity has a switch port or not.
f9e6c23 Fixed LoadBalancer unit tests! TODO: Need to change the LB to not compose flows with strings...yuck. This will make OF1.0/OF1.1+ support integration easier.
ccc14a3 Commented out all of EventTest.java's format-checking unit test. Why does the format need to be checked to see if it's ISO8601? Java's java.util.Date toString() returns a different format (with spaces), but I don't see what the big deal is at this point.
00dc75c Fixed OFMessageDamper unit tests and removed context from within OFMessageDamper (not used with a switch write anymore).
c4c8bfb Fixed LearningSwitch unit tests and a couple bugs found in the code as a result.
52eecc1 Fix IN_PORT in TopologyManager when a port is removed from an OF1.0 vs OF1.1+ switch.
ddea5b7 Fixed more unit tests. Found another place in TopologyInstance.java where I accidentally used shallow compares instead of deep when checking to see if two links are symmetrical.
ece04f2 Fixed some more unit tests. Have some device manager issues maybe. Many of the remaining unit tests to fix seem to tie back to the device manager.
5b0933b Fixed some more unit tests. In the process, discovered some errors in more overridden equals(). Also, discovered I had inadvertently commented out an important few lines the routing module uses to set the ingress port of flows used in the route. Those lines are now ported and use MatchUtils to copy the Match properly.
2de7b11 switchDisconnected() already called when the main connection is closed (so it wasn't a bug after all).
77fea4d Undo weaving of IDebugCounterService into the OFSwitch class for previous SwitchCounters implementation.
96f2ede Changed methodology after realizing the counters are already defined in OFConnectionCounters, which makes more sense since switches can have multiple connections now. OFConnectionCounters now refactored to remove counters when a switch disconnects.
bf16fa2 Added SwitchCounters.java. Similar to SwitchManagerCounters.java, the SwitchCounters class contained within contains and maintains all the counters for a switch instance. When the switch disconnects, either accidentally or forcefully with disconnect(), the SwitchCounters will be removed from the IDebugCounterService, since they will no longer be valid or meaningful if the switch never reconnects.
cb7441e Changed DebugCounterServiceImpl's registerCounter(). It turns out we do need to always return a reference to an IDebugCounter. If the counter we're trying to add is already there, return the existing IDebugCounter, else if the counter is not there, add it, and return it instead.
4b07179 Use /wm/device/all/json for all devices and /*** where *** is a filter by mac, vlan, ip, etc
5c0d006 Add 'json' to the DeviceManager's REST API to be consistent with the rest. Ending the path in a / is bad REST practice.
bff2220 Fix DebugCounter related things in core.web. Other misc optimizations in core.web.
8d5f24c remove unnecessary comments
ee7508b Added option to remove debug counters from the hierarchy if it's been added; useful for keeping track of switch or device counters, which might not stick around forever. Fixed bug in CounterNode where non-null was returned regardless of whether a counter was already present or was a new counter. DebugCounterServiceImpl prints a debug message if non-null is returned, mistakenly indicating you're adding a counter that you already had registerd (generated TONS of annoying debug messages at startup). Next bug, I accidentally initialized counters twice in the OFSwitchManager; now only done once.
e5cf49e Load balancer quick fix due to prior IPv4 packet changes. Uses LOXI IpProtocol now to reference certain protocol numbers, not IPv4 anymore.
a755263 Refactor IPv4 and UDP payload's protocol class map the proper way.
2ab3d47 Working on unit tests. Found bugs in TCP and UDP. ByteBuffer returns a (signed) short for ports, but they are valid 0-65535, not -32768-32767. Convert possibly negative ports from BB to positive ints using a bitmask.

04b75d0 Forgot to change floodlightdefault.properties; removed my TestModule and added back Forwarding.
36810ba Fixed lots of compile errors in unit tests; mostly involved replacing longs with DatapathIds, byte[]s with MacAddresses and Ipv4Addresses, and shorts with OFPorts and VlanVids; some refactoring of flow mod contruction was also done to align with loxi's builders. The static flow puser now supports IP TOS for OF1.0 and for OF1.1+ it supports match/rewrite to either ECN or DSCP bits.
f71ebe0 Merge remote-tracking branches 'upstream/master' and 'origin/openflow-1.3' into openflow-1.3
d3cc1e9 Removed jars from prior ant testing.
56efbe0 Added support for multiple flow tables in Static Flow Pusher.
4007d05 Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/rizard/floodlight
11aa1c2 Static Flow Pusher supports all OF1.3 matches and most OF1.3 actions (with the exception of masks). LoadBalancer corrected; OFFlowAdd used instead of OFFlowModify and OFPort.ZERO correct to OFPort.ANY. ActionUtils, MatchUtils, and InstructionUtils added to support static flow pusher. Strings defining flow fields *standardized* for Floodlight in the new utils classes. This means the REST API for the SFP will expect a sligthly different syntax than the current REST API (for master and 0.90). We can change the field names easily though in the utils files. These names are also referenced for the keys the SFP uses to store flow match fields and actions, just to be consistent.
559f6dc Merge pull request #1 from hwchiu/openflow-1.3

2b161f1 Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master' into openflow-1.3
3de2b50 Add j3dutils.jar to build.xml
98b7dfb Fixed build.xml. Fixed/implemented workaround for remaining debug counter compile errors to allow compilation with ant. Static Flow Pusher now matches on all OF1.3 match fields; all OF1.3 actions/set-field are in progress now, but basic out-port action works.
a229246 Quick fix for OF1.0. Should find a way so that all modules don't have to worry about how to get Match from PI. OF1.0-1.2 use pi.getInPort(); OF1.3 uses pi.getMatch(MatchField.IN_PORT). Workaroud is: (pi.getVersion().compareTo(OFVersion.OF_13) < 0 ? pi.getInPort() : pi.getMatch().get(MatchField.IN_PORT))
87b907e Quick fix for OF1.0. Should find a way so that all modules don't have to worry about how to get Match from PI. OF1.0-1.2 use pi.getInPort(); OF1.3 uses pi.getMatch(MatchField.IN_PORT). Workaroud is: (pi.getVersion().compareTo(OFVersion.OF_13) < 0 ? pi.getInPort() : pi.getMatch().get(MatchField.IN_PORT))
c7a55c9 VLAN matches added conditionally to Forwarding flows. Started moving sync code to the OFSwitchManager; not sure if SyncService needs to live there too.
473add3 Ethernet's untagged VLAN notation updated. Match.Builders created from exising Matches will only remember parent Match's MatchFields if the new builder is not modified (not very useful IMHO). MatchUtils.java added to create a new builder from and existing Match and retain all the MatchFields unless explictly overwritten with the new builder.
aded7ca Forwarding with port, L2, and, L3 matches. OFPBMC_BAD_VALUE sent back from switch for matching FL's no-VLAN notation; need to update all VLAN's = -1 to NO_VLAN instead.
c59d2f6 Ethernet fixed; proto = byte, not short. Fixed DeviceManager; toString() of Entity corrected and misc bugs. Fixed Forwarding; forgot to initialize OFSwitchService reference. Basic Forwarding works! Known issue: Forwarding only matches switch port numbers...
161962d Forgot to update overridden equals() for many classes in devicemanager package. Devices are now compared correctly and are learned and not added repeatedly.
fb618f5 Working on device manager. Currently devices aren't being saved, or cannot be located after they are stored...I'm searching incorrectly for devices and entities or am not saving them correctly or at all.

7e62ace Initial OF1.3 handshake and basic Hub module working
f32ac2f Initial OF1.3 handshake working. Still trouble write()ing to OFSwitch instance after handshake complete. The Connection is reported as down, yet the switch is echoed repeatedly w/o a problem...

224aeca Added support for enabling Tunnel End-points as next-hop for reaching end-points in an OF Cluster from a L3 NOF domain. o VRS detects traffic destined to TEP's MAC and !TEP IP and applies the   virtual routing logic to the device corresponding to dstIp. It marks the orig dst device   in the floodlight context o Forwarding checks for the orig dst device in floodlight ctxt being a TunnelEndPoint.   If so, it ensures that the packet is received on the designated port for the TEP device and   computes the route to the destination device as follows:       o Intra Cluster SourceSwitch --> DestSwitch       o Prepend {Source Switch,Port}       o Append {Dest Switch,Port} o Reconcile changes in VRS and Forwarding to handle such flows. o Junit tests
